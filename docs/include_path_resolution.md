# Summary of WinKernelLite Include Path Resolution

## Problem
The WinKernelLite library was experiencing issues with include paths, especially in examples that couldn't find the headers even though the library was correctly installed.

## Root Causes
1. Header files were installed to `include/WinKernelLite/` but examples were trying to include them directly
2. The build system was not properly setting up the include directories in the build tree
3. The FindWinKernelLite.cmake module was not comprehensive enough to find headers in all possible locations
4. The build scripts didn't properly set up the environment variables

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved CMake Configuration
- Added code to CMakeLists.txt to create the proper include directory structure in the build tree
- Added code to copy headers to the right location for examples to find them
- Expanded the include directories list in examples/CMakeLists.txt

### 2. Enhanced FindWinKernelLite.cmake
- Added more search paths for the library
- Added fallback mechanism to find headers directly if not found with the WinKernelLite prefix
- Added better debugging output

### 3. Improved Build Scripts
- Created setup_examples_env.bat to set up the environment for building examples
- Updated build_and_run.bat scripts to better handle path issues
- Created test_include_paths.bat to test if headers can be found
- Created rebuild_all.bat for a clean rebuild of everything

### 4. Better Documentation
- Created building_examples.md with detailed instructions for building examples
- Updated package_usage.md with information about the utility scripts
- Updated README.md and docs/index.md with references to the new documentation

### 5. Diagnostic Tools
- Created a comprehensive Diagnose-Build-System.ps1 PowerShell script
- Updated diagnose_install.bat to use the new diagnostic capabilities
- Added more debugging output to the CMake scripts

## Testing and Validation
- Tested building and running examples directly
- Tested build and installation process
- Verified headers can be found with the correct include path

## Conclusion
The include path issues have been resolved by improving the build system, enhancing the find module, and providing better documentation and diagnostic tools. Examples can now find the headers correctly, and users have clearer guidance on how to use the library.
